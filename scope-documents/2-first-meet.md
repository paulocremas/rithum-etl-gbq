### First meeting project scopping

## Necessary resources
* Rithum API Access (Key or Token)
  - Required to connect to the data source; nothing can be done without it.
  - Ideally, the access should be provided from an account with read-only permissions.

#### I can create both of the following items and later transfer ownership to you
If you'd prefer to do it yourself, I can send you tutorials for both options. No worries if you can't grant me access right away â€” I can already get started with just the API access.

* Google BigQuery Access
  - Editor Access to BigQuery Project
    - Required to create databases.
    - Only needed after data extraction is possible.
  - Google BigQuery Service Account
    - Required to authenticate the script to access and modify the database.
    - Only needed after the database has been created.
 
* AWS Lambda Access
  - Required to host the script and schedule it to run automatically.
  - Last resource needed to be delivered.
